      <h2>7 Years of Friendship, soon to be 8, dayum</h2>
      <p>Hopefully it turns 9 and more.</p>
      <p>
        It’s been 7 amazing years since we became friends, and soon we’ll hit 8! I can’t even put into words how much your friendship means to me. You’ve been my rock.

        Remember our pokemon roleplays? Or that time when you lied about having 2 more brothers? (Still salty about it 😒)
      </p>
      <p>To be honest, i dont know what else to say, its been SOOO long and the fact i was just a little stupid baby, to now going through puberty, its INSANE. From the roleplays, to the hangouts, to the p diddy meepcity parties, to our fnaf phase, its insane. Genuineley, you are my fucking soulmate, without you, i dont know where id be or what id be. You changed me and helped me in so many situations, even at my lowest, you didnt dare to leave or anything. That one time when i told you i wanted to kill myself, i thought you would be mad at me, but you werent. When i lied about stuff and you found out, i thought our friendship was over and you hated me, but you didnt dare to leave. I love you, you dumh fucking whore. ❤️</p>
