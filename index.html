      <p>Hopefully it turns 9 and more.</p>
      <p>
        Itâ€™s been 7 amazing years since we became friends, and soon weâ€™ll hit 8! I canâ€™t even put into words how much your friendship means to me. Youâ€™ve been my rock.

        Remember our pokemon roleplays? Or that time when you lied about having 2 more brothers? (Still salty about it ðŸ˜’)
      </p>
      <p>Love you, you amazing weirdo. ðŸ’–</p>
